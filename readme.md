## ✅ 30 Days — 3-Liner Descriptions

**Day 1 — AWS Intro**  
Understand public vs private cloud, why companies migrate to AWS, and set up your AWS account with billing alerts.

**Day 2 — IAM**  
Manage users, groups, and roles securely. Enforce MFA and least privilege. Control access to AWS resources.

**Day 3 — Organizations**  
Structure multiple AWS accounts, set up budgets, and avoid surprise charges with cost controls.

**Day 4 — EC2**  
Launch virtual servers, configure SSH and security groups, and deploy Jenkins for automation.

**Day 5 — VPC**  
Build a secure Virtual Private Cloud, design subnets, and set up Internet/NAT Gateways.

**Day 6 — Load Balancer & ASG**  
Distribute traffic with ALB, add EC2 to Target Groups, and configure Auto Scaling for high availability.

**Day 7 — S3**  
Store and manage files, enable versioning, and host a static website on S3.

**Day 8 — Route 53 & CloudFront**  
Register domains, set up DNS, and distribute content globally with CloudFront CDN.

**Day 9 — Secrets Manager**  
Store API keys and passwords securely, automate secret rotation, and avoid hardcoding sensitive data.

**Day 10 — DynamoDB**  
Learn NoSQL basics, create tables, and perform CRUD operations with the CLI.

**Day 11 — Cognito**  
Build secure sign-up/sign-in, handle JWT tokens, and integrate authentication with your apps.

**Day 12 — SNS & SQS**  
Implement pub/sub messaging with SNS, queue tasks with SQS, and build scalable architectures.

**Day 13 — Lambda**  
Run code serverlessly, trigger functions with S3/DynamoDB, and manage permissions.

**Day 14 — API Gateway**  
Create secure REST APIs, connect to Lambda/backends, and manage throttling and usage plans.

**Day 15 — CloudWatch**  
Collect logs and metrics, create dashboards, and set alarms for notifications.

**Day 16 — CloudTrail & Config**  
Track API calls for auditing, enforce compliance, and stay secure with Config rules.

**Day 17 — CodeCommit & CI/CD**  
Host code in private Git repos, automate builds, and orchestrate CI/CD pipelines.

**Day 18 — CodeDeploy**  
Automate deployments to EC2/ECS, implement Blue/Green strategies, and enable easy rollbacks.

**Day 19 — Systems Manager**  
Manage EC2 without SSH, use Session Manager for secure access, and automate patching.

**Day 20 — EventBridge & Step Functions**  
Build event-driven workflows, orchestrate AWS services, and automate tasks serverlessly.

**Day 21 — ECR**  
Store and manage private Docker images, push/pull securely, and integrate with ECS/EKS.

**Day 22 — ECS & Fargate**  
Run containers at scale, deploy with Task Definitions, and manage updates automatically.

**Day 23 — EKS**  
Launch Kubernetes clusters, deploy workloads, and manage pods, nodes, and scaling.

**Day 24 — Terraform**  
Use Infrastructure as Code, build and apply reproducible infra, and manage high availability.

**Day 25 — Backup & DR**  
Automate backups, restore EC2/RDS snapshots, and build disaster recovery playbooks.

**Day 26 — Cost Optimization**  
Analyze spending with Cost Explorer, create budgets, and tag resources for cost control.

**Day 27 — CI/CD Project**  
Automate image builds, deploy Docker images to ECS with ECR, and ensure smooth rollouts.

**Day 28 — Serverless App**  
Combine API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to build a secure REST API with Cognito auth.

**Day 29 — 500+ Interview Q&A**  
Prepare for AWS/DevOps interviews, practice scenario-based questions, and boost your confidence.

**Day 30 — Final Capstone**
